## Built in functions

In python we have lots of built-in functions. Built-in functions are globally available for your use. Some of the most commonly used python built-in functions are the following: _print()_, _len()_, _type()_, _int()_, _float()_, _str()_, _input()_, _list()_, _dict()_, _min()_, _max()_, _sum()_,_abs()_, _round()_,  _sorted()_,_list()_, _tuple()_, _dict_(),  _open()_, _file()_, _help()_, and _dir()_. In the following table you will see an exhaustive list of python built-in functions taken from [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html).

Let's open the python shell and start using some of the most common built-in functions.

Let's practice more by using different built-in functions

As you can see from the terminal above, python has got reserved words. We do not use reserved words to declare variables or functions. We will cover variables in the next section.

I believe, by now you are familiar with built-in functions. Let's do one more practice of built-in functions and we will move on to the next section

## Variables

Variables store data in a computer memory. Mnemonic variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored.
Number at the beginning, special character, hyphen are not allowed when naming them. A variable can have a short name (like x,y,z), but a more descriptive name (firstname, lastname, age, country) is highly recommended.
Python Variable Name Rules

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and \_ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME are different variables)

Valid variable names

```shell
firstname
lastname
age
country
city
first_name
last_name
capital_city
_if # if we want to use reserved word as a variable
year_2019
year2019
current_year_2019
num1
num2
```

Invalid variables names

```shell
first-name
num-1
1num
```

We will use standard python variable naming style which has been adopted by many python developers. The example below is an example of standard naming of variables, underscore when the variable name is long.

When we assign a certain data type to a variable, it is called variable declaration. For instance in the example below my first name is assigned to a variable first_name. The equal sign is an assignment operator. Assigning means storing data in the variable.

_Example:_

```py
# Variables in Python

first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
country = 'Finland'
city = 'Helsinki'
age = 250
is_married = True
skills = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Python']
person_info = {
   'firstname':'Asabeneh',
   'lastname':'Yetayeh',
   'country':'Finland',
   'city':'Helsinki'
   }
```

Let's use _print()_ and _len()_ built in functions. Print function will take multiple arguments. An argument is a value which we pass or put inside the function parenthesis, see the example below.

**Example:**

```py
print('Hello, World!')
print('Hello',',', 'World','!') # it can take multiple arguments
print(len('Hello, World!')) # it takes only one argument
```

Let's print and also find the length of the variables declared at the top:

**Example:**

```py
# Printing the values stored in the variables

print('First name:', first_name)
print('First name length:', len(first_name))
print('Last name: ', last_name)
print('Last name length: ', len(last_name))
print('Country: ', country)
print('City: ', city)
print('Age: ', age)
print('Married: ', is_married)
print('Skills: ', skills)
print('Person information: ', person_info)
```

Variables can also be declared in one line:

**Example:**

```py
first_name, last_name, country, age, is_married = 'Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 'Helsink', 250, True

print(first_name, last_name, country, age, is_married)
print('First name:', first_name)
print('Last name: ', last_name)
print('Country: ', country)
print('Age: ', age)
print('Married: ', is_married)
```

Getting user input using the _input()_ built-in function. Let's assign the data we get from a user into first_name and age variables.
**Example:**

```py
first_name = input('What is your name: ')
age = input('How old are you? ')

print(first_name)
print(age)
```

## Data Types

There are several data types in python. To identify the data type we use the _type_ builtin function. I would like you to focus on understanding different data types very well. When it comes to programming, it is all about data types. I introduced data types at the very beginning and it comes again, because every topic is related to data types. We will cover data types in more detail in their respective sections.

## Checking Data types and Casting

- Check Data types: To check the data type of certain data/variable we use the _type_
  **Example:**

```py
# Different python data types
# Let's declare variables with various data types

first_name = 'Asabeneh'     # str
last_name = 'Yetayeh'       # str
country = 'Finland'         # str
city= 'Helsinki'            # str
age = 250                   # int, it is not my real age, don't worry about it

# Printing out types
print(type('Asabeneh'))     # str
print(type(first_name))     # str
print(type(10))             # int
print(type(3.14))           # float
print(type(1 + 1j))         # complex
print(type(True))           # bool
print(type([1, 2,3,4]))     # list
print(type({'name':'Asabeneh','age':250, 'is_married':250}))    # dict
print(type((1,2)))                                              # tuple
print(type(zip([1,2],[3,4])))                                   # set
```

- Casting: Converting one data type to another data type. We use _int()_, _float()_, _str()_, _list_
  When we do arithmetic operations string numbers should be first converted to int or float otherwise it will return an error. If we concatenate a number with string, the number should be first converted to a string. We will talk about concatenation in String section.
  **Example:**

```py
# int to float

num_int = 10
print('num_int',num_int)         # 10
num_float = float(num_int)
print('num_float:', num_float)   # 10.0

# float to int

gravity = 9.81
print(int(gravity))             # 9

# int to str
num_int = 10
print(num_int)                  # 10
num_str = str(num_int)
print(num_str)                  # '10'

# str to int
num_str = '10.6'
print('num_int', int(num_str))      # 10
print('num_float', float(num_str))  # 10.6

# str to list
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
print(first_name)
print(first_name)                    # 'Asabeneh'
first_name_to_list = list(first_name)
print(first_name_to_list)            # ['A', 's', 'a', 'b', 'e', 'n', 'e', 'h']
```

## Numbers

Number data types in python:

1. Integers: Integer(negative, zero and positive) numbers
   Example:
   ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...

2. Floating Point Numbers(Decimal numbers)
   Example:
   ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ...

3. Complex Numbers
   Example:
   1 + j, 2 + 4j, 1 - 1j
